    <h1>Understanding Diet, Habits, and Outer Factors in Diabetes and the Public's Health</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to the Home Page</h2>
    <p>For our project, we decided to investigate the complex interplay between income
      disparities and personal choices regarding food and nutrition policies. Using a complete
      and extensive dataset, we will examine the different correlations that can be made
      between the consumers' diet / health and multiple outer factors, like income levels and
      food prices. Further numbers we will analyze include, for example, physical activity levels
      and drug use, to understand dietary habits and health outcomes. We will combine our
      findings and visualize them, with our goal being to inform on the intricate influences on
      everyday nutritional policies and personal choices regarding dieting and healthier
      lifestyles.</p>
      <h3>Regarding the perspectives we looked at</h3>
      <p>Perspective 1: Income Disparities and Nutritional Inequality
        This perspective is about the impact of income inequality on nutritional inequality. We will
        analyze our data on income and food prices, and use this data to display how economic
        factors contribute to difference in access to certain types of food. Our aim is to explore any
        correlations between these two topics, and explore how these might come to be. This
        could shed light on the importance of economy on dietary habits, and could help with
        finding solutions to prominent health risks in today's society.</p>
        <p>Perspective 2: Personal Responsibility and Education
        In our second perspective, we focus on the role of personal responsibility and education in
        shaping healthier dietary choices. For this perspective, we will need to make use of our
        other data regarding more personal choices, such as physical activity, drug use and
        education. With this information, we might find correlations between everyday habits and
        overall health outcomes. We will analyze these correlations and visualize them, which
        could help in finding effective methods of improving society's overall health with not just
        nutrition policies, but perhaps also through other means.</p>
